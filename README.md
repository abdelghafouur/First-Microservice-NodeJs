# First_Microservice_node_Js 🚀

Welcome to First_Microservice_node_Js! This project provides a simple demonstration of a microservices architecture using Node.js. It consists of two microservices: `commande-service` and `produit-service`, which work together to manage orders and products.

## Microservices Overview

### Commande-Service 📦

The `commande-service` microservice handles order management functionality. It allows users to create new orders, retrieve existing orders, update order status, and perform other order-related operations.

### Produit-Service 🛍️

The `produit-service` microservice is responsible for managing product information. It allows users to retrieve product details, add new products, update product information, and perform other product-related operations.

## Getting Started 🚀

To run the microservices locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/abdelghafouur/First_Microservice_node_Js.git
   
3. Install dependencies for each microservice:

- cd First_Microservice_node_Js/commande-service
- npm install
- cd ../produit-service
- npm install
  
3. Start each microservice:
   
- cd commande-service
- npm start
- cd ../produit-service
- npm start

4. Access the microservices:
- Commande-Service: http://localhost:3000
- Produit-Service: http://localhost:4000
